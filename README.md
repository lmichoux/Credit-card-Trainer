Digital Memory Training
-----------------------
Description
This is a simple web-based game designed to help users practice and improve their ability to memorize sequences of numbers, specifically formatted like a credit card number with an expiration date and CVV. With a bit of practice, users can train themselves to memorize a full card's details in just a few seconds.

Features
Random Number Generation: Each game generates a unique 16-digit card number, a 2-digit month, a 2-digit year, and a 3-digit CVV.

Adjustable Difficulty: Users can set the display time for the numbers, from 1 to 20 seconds, using a simple slider.

Interactive Recall: After the numbers disappear, an input form is presented for the user to enter what they remember.

Auto-Focus Input Fields: The cursor automatically moves to the next input box once a section is filled, making data entry faster.

Detailed Scoring: The results screen provides:

A side-by-side comparison of the original numbers and the user's input.

Color-coded feedback on the user's answer (green for correct digits, red for incorrect).

A final score out of 23.

A graduated comment based on the score, ranging from "Cerveau en panne ?" (Brain dead?) to "Bravo, vous Ãªtes au top !" (Bravo, you're the best!).

How to Use
Open the entrainement_cerebral.html file in any modern web browser.

On the settings screen, use the slider to choose how long you want the numbers to be displayed.

Click the "Commencer" (Start) button.

Focus and memorize the numbers shown on the screen.

Once the timer runs out, you will be taken to the input screen. Enter the numbers you recall into the corresponding fields.

Click the "VALIDER" (Submit) button.
